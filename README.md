## Description  
This repository contains 4 Python files for CSE 4283.  
* `assignment2.py` contains the functions to take in height and weight as user input, calculate the user's BMI, and inform the user of what category their BMI is.  
* `test_assignment2.py` contains the functions from `assignment2.py` as well as pytest parametrization and assertions to test correct output of the functions.
* `assignment2-boundShift.py` contains the same code as `assignment2.py` but shifts the lower boundary of the normal category up 0.1
* `test_assignment2-boundShift.py` contains the functions from `assignment2-boundShift.py` as well as pytest parametrization and assertions to test correct output of the functions.
